Ashley Iles: Android Dev Team
==========
Overall I do belive that the group that I was part of was quite sucessful, the final product are two very functional and easy to use pices of software. My previous, but limited, experiance / knowledge of git and github was very usefull during the project. This resulted in myself requiring help with git to be a very infrequent event. When refining the UI desing in android studio that either the other group members or myself had created I found myself frequently editing the XML files directly. Cleaning up the mess and unnecessary attributes that the Ide had created and left behind was quite satisfying.That said I found myself feeling underwhelmed and rather unmotivated, especially compared to others in my group. This feeling did change during the testing week, working in close proximity to my other group members was something I found very beneficial.

Estimated time spent on project ~70 hours.
