Charlie - ITW
===============
Role: Deputy  Lead, Lead Android Developer
Subject: Integration and Testing week
---------------

This week, the team pulled together really well - we all played to our strengths, and unofficial turnaround time for bug fixes was usually under an hour. The less capable members of the team added value to the project by testing intensively. This week was extremely intense for me personally - a large part of the week was spent polishing template code in the Android repository, so that there was enough information for other team members to implement core functionality. This involved some extremely long nights, and as such I did make it in a little late a few times during ITW. However, I don't think anybody on the team begrudged this as they realised that I was putting in many more hours in the evenings.

There were a few issues this week - to my displeasure, I was forced to work extremely long hours the night before the deadline implementing missing and broken functionality in the website. Quality control appeared to have been absent during the development process of the Website code, and I spent many hours trying to debug and fix poorly formatted code; in fact, it was so poorly formatted as to be nearly unreadable. After several hours reformatting the PHP and JavaScript code, I finally managed to correct the issue causing problems and implement the missing functionality in the website.

This situation was partially due to poor communication - some members of the team were reluctant to say they had difficulty performing a task, and this had an impact later on. When the web team required help, the other developers were extremely busy with the Android code base and were limited on time, meaning that we couldn't help effectively.
