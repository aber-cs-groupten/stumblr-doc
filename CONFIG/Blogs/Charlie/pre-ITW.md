Role: Deputy  Lead, Lead Android Developer
Subject: Weekly blog - Week before Integration and Testing week
---------------

The week prior to I&TW was spent finishing the basis for the Android code - that is, implementing the data structures and activity-switching code necessary to fulfil the functional requirements of the application. This preliminary work also involved constructing a coherent list of functions that needed to be implemented and tested during the course of the week. This involved the HTTP and JSON interaction with the web server, and provisional allocation of tasks.
