Personal Reflective Report
==========================

Overall, I'd feel the project was succesful. Despite being slow to start, the group
began to work more effectively as a team during Integration and Testing Week, to a point
that our "turnaround time" for bug fixes was less than an hour. The majority of the app
functionality was implemented and the vast majority of tests passed.

The major test of the project was the process of getting to know the team's
abilities initially, it was difficult learning everybody's strengths and weaknesses.
We worked together as a whole, although I feel perhaps that I did more work than
was my 'fair share'. This was due to perhaps underestimating the amount of work that
would be involved in the project, and the learning curve for the project tools 
(Git, GitHub, and LaTeX) all presented a challenge for the team and was a recurring
difficulty throughout the project.

Personally, I enjoyed the project. The Android development was interesting and good
fun, as well as complementing my skill set as a programmer. Working on a code base
with a small team was a new experience for me - one that I enjoyed overall. Working in
a team enabled better discovery of flaws, faster turnaround time on bug fixes, and
more efficient code as we held informal code reviews often during Integration and
Testing Week.

If I were to repeat the project - personally, I'd have learned a little more about 
Git and GitHub before the project started. Learning about Git is one thing, but it's
very different to use in a group setting, and can be quite a steep learning curve for 
a new user. This became less of a problem as the project progressed, and I was able
to help others - but this was initially a problem as it would have been more useful 
to be able to help some of the other team members with learning project tools - 
instead of spending time learning them myself.

Total time spent on project

Estimated at 125 hours.
