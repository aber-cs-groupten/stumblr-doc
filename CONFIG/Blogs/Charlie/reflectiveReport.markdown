Personal Reflective Report
==========================

Overall, I'd feel the project was successful. Despite being slow to start, the group
began to work more effectively as a team during Integration and Testing Week, to a point
that our "turnaround time" for bug fixes was less than an hour. The majority of the app
functionality was implemented and the vast majority of tests passed.

The major difficulty of the project was the process of getting to know the team's
abilities initially, it was difficult learning everybody's strengths and weaknesses.
We worked together as a whole, although I feel perhaps that I did more work than
was my 'fair share'. This was due to perhaps underestimating the amount of work that
would be involved in the project, and the learning curve for the project tools 
(Git, GitHub, and LaTeX) all presented a challenge for the team and was a recurring
difficulty throughout the project, requiring help from myself and Daniel.

We also faced a number of problems with group members, including late submissions of
work from some group members (for internal deliverables), poor attendance, and extremely
poor communication. This led to a number of complications that I feel myself and
Daniel have had to take on disproportionate workloads to compensate for.
In all, I did a very large portion of the overall work, and this has been a
major frustration to me during the course of the project.

Despite this, I enjoyed the project. The Android development was interesting,
as well as complementing my own skill set as a developer. Working on a code base
with a small team was a new experience for me - one that I enjoyed overall. Working in
a team enabled better discovery of flaws, faster turnaround time on bug fixes, and
more efficient code as we held informal code reviews often during Integration and
Testing Week. Outside of ITW, the team were generally good to work with, although
the difficulties mentioned above did somewhat sour the experience.

If I were to repeat the project - personally, I'd have learned a little more about 
Git and GitHub before the project started. Learning about Git is one thing, but it's
very different to use in a group setting, and can be quite a steep learning curve for 
a new user. This became less of a problem as the project progressed, and I was able
to help others - but this was initially a problem as it would have been more useful 
to be able to help some of the other team members with learning project tools - 
instead of spending time learning them myself.
