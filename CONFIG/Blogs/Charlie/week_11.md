This week, work began on the protocols - including communication between the database and Android app. We set up an experimental MySQL database on my web server, but we had some problems getting it to connect (we think Ystwyth blocks connections on port 3306). I started preliminary work on the Android interfaces, as well as researching Android API elements.

Had to emphasise blogs again in the group meeting - they are not getting completed.

PROTOTYPE DEMO:
We showed the software in its current state to Bernie this week, after a little frantic work implementing template code for Functional Requirements! The Android API is very well documented and made writing the software easy to plan, although we may have to make some design changes later on due to the structure of some API elements.
