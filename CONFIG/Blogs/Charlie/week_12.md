Subject: Weekly blog - Christmas holidays
---------------

This blog post is for the duration of the Christmas holidays - I have made significant progress with the Android app, despite accidentally causing a few team issues by editing code in the Master branch on GitHub. I have put in place a fairly solid foundation for the Android code, putting a coherent structure for the Activities and data classes. The basic functionality is now improved over the prototype demo as the GPS code works in synchronicity with the UI.
