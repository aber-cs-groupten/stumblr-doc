Content

Spent some time this week in meetings, plotting out the class structure
and functionality required in the Android app. Discussed several possible features,
which were dismissed due to time limitations and the functionality not being required
in the specification (i.e. feature creep). Also discussed detailed design in the second
meeting, as well as topics like API features used, Java libraries and other elements.

Was annoyed about the lack of blog posts from the team - communicated this during the meetings.

Time

6 hours
