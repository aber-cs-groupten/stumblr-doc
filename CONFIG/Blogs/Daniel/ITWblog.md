Daniel Clark - ITW

Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 60 hours 
Subject: Integration and Testing Week (Finally!)
---------------

This week was Integration and Testing week and it went extremely well (despite a weather worry at the end).  We managed to add in every feature we planned to, however we found out late on thursday/friday morning that there were 2 extra features we had missed out, so unfortunately they stayed missing (multiple photos per waypoint and only single word route titles). 
The team worked well together and at the end we had some very good quality code, fully commented and tested thoughrouly. In the last night of the project me, Charlie and Ashley stayed up late working on fixing code and adding mainly Charlie worked on adding a feature to the web side that had been plaguing Stephen for days.
I personally really enjoyed Integration and Testing Week and apart from some absences there were very few PBCAKs (Problems Between the Chairs And the Keyboards).
I'm very proud of most of my group over ITW for making sure that what needed to get done, got done.
