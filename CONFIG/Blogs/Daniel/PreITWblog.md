Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 25 hours 
Subject: Time between Christmas and ITW
---------------

In this time we found out that due to the weather, both exams and ITW were to be pushed back a week. This meant we had more time to focus on putting down all the ground work for ITW. Charlie did a lot of work on making the structures needed for the Android code whilst other group members focused on putting features into that framework. We also decided which features were to be worked on first by which team members during ITW (but of course when they finish that feature, they then will move onto the next feature/bug).
