Time Working On Project: 3 hours 
Subject: Introductions
---------------

This week, in our first meeting of the year, we each introduced ourselves and started to get to know eachother. We also met bernie who was to be our Group Manager for the project (As well as the customer). Group roles wer mentioned but it was decided to leave that decision until next week. From what I've seen of the group so far I think this is going to be a great project, especially as i already know a few members of my group.
