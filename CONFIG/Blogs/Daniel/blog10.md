Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 9 hours 
Subject: Prototypes
---------------

This week everyone started work on the Prototype for the demonstration to Bernie (the customer). Charlie, Ashley, Martin and Kenny started work on their individual parts of the Android app, whilst Stephen, Mark and Kieran started working together on their Prototype. There were some problems getting the database to connect but they should be sorted soon.

At the end of the week (today) we presented our final prototype to Bernie and recieved some very possitive feedback, including that he'd seen no other groups that had the HTTP Post working (work which I had done)
