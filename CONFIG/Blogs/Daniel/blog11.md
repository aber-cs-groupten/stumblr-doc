Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 10 hours 
Subject: Christmas Holidays
---------------

Over the Christmas Holidays he had a few problems caused by Charlie directly editing the Master Android github branch which was very out of date and exclusively for submission quality code. The branch everybody was meant to work on was the Prototype Branch where work was being done (unless it was a complex feature in which case it was done in a branch of its own). In the end though Charlie worked through the problem with some guidance from me and we ended up with better structured code after all. Also everybodys features are coming along and we should have an almost working app by the start of Integration and Testing Week. (Even if exams and ITW might be delayed)
