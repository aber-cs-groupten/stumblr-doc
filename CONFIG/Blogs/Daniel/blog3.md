Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 3 hours 
Subject: Facebook, Git and GUIs
---------------

This week I set up the group facebook page so that we can easily communicate meetings and ideas. I also started working on setting up the Github repository because I have lots of Git experience, although I have decided to wait until after the Git workshop to see what structure we will need to have in the Git repository. Also Ashley presented his GUI design which definitely looks like a good start and let other group memebers start work on the Use Case diagrams.
