Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 3 hours 
Subject: Git and LaTeX
---------------

This week, after Charlie had finished the LaTeX template for the group, we started to make sure that everybody could upload the work they had done to Github for Charlie to integrate into the first document. The Git repository was now fully set up and I did a brief overview of Git for the group members that didn't already know it.
