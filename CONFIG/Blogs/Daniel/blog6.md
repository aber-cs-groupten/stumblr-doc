Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 5 hours 
Subject: Design Docs
---------------

This week we started work on the design documentation. In our non-official group meeting we set out the roles that each person will have to to complete for their section of document. Using github issues as a way for each person to easily know what their actions are seems to be catching on a bit better, as people remember to check them regularly for new task. I've also decided that from now on all documentation (except stuff that has tables) will be done in either Markdown or LaTeX, as markup languages are far more 'git happy' than .odt. Of course doing tables in markdown is impracticle and if people aren't confident in latex, it's not really practicle either, so .odt is still just about acceptable for tables, for nwo.
