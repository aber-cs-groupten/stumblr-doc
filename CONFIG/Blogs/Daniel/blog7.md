This week we continued work on the Design docs, set internal deadlines for parts of the doc and drew out a rough set of class diagrams. Personally  i set about doing the algorithms and making sure everybody kept on track with the internal deadlines we set. The project seems to be going pretty well, no major hickups at this point and most people seem to be doing their bit. The major problem at the moment is that some group members aren't turning up to meetings, and are also not contributing as much as the rest of the group.
