Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 6 hours 
Subject: Diagrams and Features
---------------

This week we spent a lot of time in our meeting room bashing out a decent class diagram for the project and a set of data structures. This included deciding which features to keep, and which to remove, as well as where and how the kept ones would be implemented.
