Role: Group Leader

Time Working On Project: 8 hours 
Subject: Design Spec Finalising
---------------

This week we colated together all the work that had been done for the Design spec. People have also been finishing of the issues they had with the Project Plan. I setup the Github Issues for the Test Specification updates, and continued to chase people for missing pieces of the Design Doc. We've now got a backbone setup for the code, meaning that when we start coding on the 6th, it should be easy to fill in the blanks. Most things are going well at the moment, but will having problems with a few group members not turning up to meetings when they should, and not contributing as much as they could.
