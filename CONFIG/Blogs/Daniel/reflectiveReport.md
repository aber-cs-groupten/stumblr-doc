Daniel's Personal Reflective Report
===================================

I think on ballance the project went extremely well. As with other groups it took us some time to get to know eachother and learn eachothers strenghts and weaknesses, but as time progressed the speed and effieciency at which we worked greatly increased.
One of the major problems we had in the group to start was that, having never worked together before, we had no idea what eachother cosidered as 'good', and what we all expected of eachother. As the project progressed it was obvious that some group members were more motivated to succeed than others, but in general there was definitely a possitive attiude toward the group throughout.
During Integration and Testing week the group really started to become a unit, where everybody knew what they were doing and always knew what the next step to take was. 

As an individual I really enjoyed the project, learning how to use development tools and teqniques effectively, learning about the Android development environment and how powerful the Android API is. Also learning about PHP, as language i've never even touched before, was extremely interesting and has given me a much better backround in the topic for further progression.
As Group leader I feel that I did a good job leading the team, maybe at times not the best but I still think I've manged to lead the team into getting the desired result. Leading a team with such varied abilities has taught me an aweful lot about how important good communication is, and how it's important to make sure that each member of the team feals like they are making a valuable contribution to the project. I also learnt that being liked by your group is extremly important in keeping up group moral throughout long projects, as without that the entire group ethos can fall down.

Although I did end up spending massive amounts of time on the project, I always expected this and that is one of the reasons I put myself forward as group leader. This is because I was only taking 50 credits in the first semester which left me much more time to focus on the project and its development. 

If I were to ever repeat the project or one of a similar nature, I'd have made sure i put more effort into making sure every team member got the support they needed and felt that they could ask for extra help/resources if needed. Also, although I tried to enforce good Git practice rigth from the get-go, next time I would definitely focus more on making sure every single team member was completely happy with using it's basic opperations and how to deal with conflics.
