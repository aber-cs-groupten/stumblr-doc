Its done, more or less, its done. And it works really well.

I'm glad the app works really well. I'm also glad that I learnt some new things, like being able to use GitHub (sort of). 
I also got to create the mascot/icon for our app, write some code, field test the app, point out errors, and just
generally being useful to my group. I'm not the strongest programmer, or computer science student in general, 
so I felt I had to be useful wherever I could to compensate for this. The fact that we had a really good leader and deputy,
meant that I could easily ask for help with any project stuff, and that meant I could get a good amount of work done.
I improved with computer science stuff, which is good. The fact that we managed to create something useful (in theory), 
from basically nothing but an IDE and some programming know how. In a general sense, Its renewed my faith in programming in Java.
