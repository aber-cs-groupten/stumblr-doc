This week we got introduced to each other. Also met bernie. Group has some the most talented people in my year, the fact I've been put with them to equalise the group with other groups makes me feel a bit like a deadweight. Talked about strengths and weaknesses, dont have any known strengths, so I was honest. Honesty is a strength I guess. Looking foward to the project as a whole. I'm hoping I'll learn something new.
