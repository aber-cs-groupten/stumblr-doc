This week we got introduced to each other. Also met bernie. 
 Group has some the most talented people in my year, the fact I've been put with them to equalise the group with other groups makes me feel a bit like a deadweight.
 Talked about strengths and weaknesses, dont have any known strengths, so I was honest.
 Honesty is a strength I guess.
 Looking foward to the project as a whole.
 I'm hoping I'll learn something new.

Some Content Ideas:
  * What the group did
  * What you did
  * How you're feeling about the project
  * What's going well
  * What's not going so well
  * etc

This should be done at least weekly, can only be a few lines and shouldn't really take more than 5-10 minutes
