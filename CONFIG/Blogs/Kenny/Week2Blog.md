This week we decided roles. I'm an android developer, theres 4 of us. Volunteered to take on a good bit of the project plan. Bernie said it was too much for one person, he was right but I just wanted to be of some use. I got the introduction to the design spec, took a few hours. We had to get some planning done first, and had meetings outside the mentor slot.
