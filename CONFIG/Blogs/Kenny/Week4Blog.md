This week Charlie presented an updated use case diagram. Got the work I was set done. Also had a 101 on GitHub and LaTeX in an unofficial meeting. I think that things like LaTeX and Github are unnecessarily convoluted, though I'm probably not seeing the bigger picture. More meetings. I needed to have Github explained to me a lot of times. It must be getting really frustrating for our group leader. Its a lot like when my mum tries to use the internet. Trying to help out wherever I can though. Need to have better puntuation to meetings, I've been very late to quite a few.
