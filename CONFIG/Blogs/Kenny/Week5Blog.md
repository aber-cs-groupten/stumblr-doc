This week, the project plan has been submitted, and we got feedback. I didn't have to make any changes to my part. On an unrelated note, I was running late to the meeting, but I had a HUGE spider situation at home. I didnt have time for sense, so I ended up bringing the spider to the meeting. In a jar. We laughed about it. Something thats a common fear put us in a good mood. Ironic really.
