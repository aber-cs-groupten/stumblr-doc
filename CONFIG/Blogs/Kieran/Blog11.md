---------------

 This week is intergation and testing week. We have been instrudructed to be on campus 9-5 every day to ensure the project is completed on time. My tasks are to aid with the web development and my main task was the general theme of the interface. I have been creating banners and appropriate colour themes, there was also an issue with the database which by the time I had come to a solution the problem had been resolved.
      Over all I felt that the project was a great idea to give students the chance to work as part of a team to create a functioning product. Having the chance to demonstrate the things we have learned in a practicle fasion is very rewarding. My only crisism is that I felt very unprepaired  for the use of githut. There was help given but it was not very helpful. My advice for the university is that if they plan to use github in the future to give more direct help/instuctions, possibly in the group meetings.
