  The website prototype was presented to Bernie and he gave some feedback, generally it was good  but there were issues with the API which where overcome by some hardcoding. As a prototype it was sufficient in that it clearly displayed the overall jist of the site. We were also given tasks and things to be concidered over the christmas break.
