Personal Reflective Report

I feel that the project was overall enjoyable and I learned a considerable amount. However I do feel that I did not apply or commit myself as much as I could, but realising that is positive. I have gained experience from this project and I have grown academically and personally. The main aspect that I appreciate that it was a productive break from learning and being able to apply what I have already learned was refreshing.

There were issues during construction of the software but over coming them in teams was very helpful in gaining usable experience.
