-----------------------------------
ITW week started off better then it finished. There were some problems with the site interacting with the databse which i solved. Then we encountered problems displaying the data as markers on the Gmaps, therefore I wrote some php which would convert tours into XML files. Then the site was pretty much fully functional as alot of the work was done before the week started. My final task in ITW was to create a scrollable gallery along the bottom of the webpage showing the images from a tour.
