Review
-----------------------------------
I think that the project went very well. The start of the term involved alot of documentation which we completed and got good grades on. Then when it came to producing the system i felt it went better then i expected it to go. I was mainly involved with the web side of the system, there were a few problems which we encountered and at the beginning I didn't expect everything to go smoothly. But these were all fixed and all the requirements where met.
