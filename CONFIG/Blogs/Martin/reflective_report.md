Role: Android Developer

Personal Reflective Report
-----------------------------------

Overall, I think the project went well. There was really good communication throughout amongst the group, and I feel that we produced a final product to a high standard. At the beginning of the project I was a bit nervous about being a developer, but everyone was supportive and I never faced a problem that I could not solve even if it did take some time to get through.

I really enjoyed learning how to develop android programs. It was challenging but rewarding when we succeeded and reached our goals. I feel we had the right approach by having lots of short term goals, opposed to trying to complete a whole segment of the program in one go.

If I were to repeat the project I would have liked to have been taught Git in a more practical way, but thankfully my group members had some Git experience. Also, I would have used the advisory service more as I wasted a lot of time on bugs.

Total time spent on project
