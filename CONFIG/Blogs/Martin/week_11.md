This week is the integration and testing week. As everyone did small bits over Christmas I felt we went in with a head start and a lot of confidence which boosted our work effort. For most of the week I was first tasked with writing appropriate "checks" for the app, e.g checking if wifi/gps/network provider is enabled etc. I feel like I learnt a lot from my developer group members and that we worked well as a team. 

I also took part in a lot of the practical or, "field testing" which involved walking around campus to test adding waypoints and tracking distance travelled. 

Overall I enjoyed integration and testing week. I think it went relatively smoothly and everyone contributed to the final product whilst working well together.
