Began talking about the test specification. Bernie made a lot of suggested which I noted. Mark was tasked with some points of the test specification and I was tasked with the rest. I then had a look at the example documents to see how past groups had structured their tests and what I could add to ours. I will have to have it completed by the next group meeting.
