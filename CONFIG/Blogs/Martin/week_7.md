Completed the test specification. We went through some of it, some boundary and invalid character tests were suggested to add. Dan assigned it as an enhancement on git hub. We talked a bit more about interface design and discussed some class design. I was tasked with completing Decomposition Description which I will have a draft of by the next meeting (29/11).
