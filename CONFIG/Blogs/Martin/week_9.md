This week we worked on the prototype. I was tasked with getting the location services for the app working. Unfortunately I wasted a lot of time struggling with some android studio issues but eventually got it working. We then presented the prototype to Bernie and tasks over Christmas were assigned to give us a head start in integration and testing week.
