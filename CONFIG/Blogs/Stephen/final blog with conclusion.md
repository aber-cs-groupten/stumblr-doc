This week is the the intergration and testing week we started off by writing down what has to be finished for both sides of the project, I worked with mark getting the website to get the data from the server to be used on the web page. Both of us finally got it working and we incorporated it with the google maps to create markers that contain images using information on the server provided by the app. I spent more time tidying up the javascript for the Google map and trying to get it to create a route on the map with the co-ordinates we got from the app finally got it working with some help from charlie. With that done me and mark and kieron worked on the desing of the site and with thelp from them we made the map 100% of the body of the webpage and created a gallary bar below the map that holds all the images of the tours selected with their title and description. We finally sat down and tested the website the ways we could such as inputs and if it worked on different browsers and it did.
