Personal reflective report
---------------
Well I think the group project went great the group worked well as part of a team and we got the project working on both web and app side. I learnt a decent amount about how to use google maps when creating a web page which means I learnt more javascript, also with the database interaction I had to do some PHP,SQL and XML. The only thing i would have changed was learning how to use git before the project started as it was difficult to learn while doing and made some minor errors.

We had a few problems with the website like not having a database up and running for a while and the database interaction with the Google maps JavaScript, but this was all sorted out and was finally fixed.

Personaly I found the project enjoyable I learnt alot and was fun at some times.
