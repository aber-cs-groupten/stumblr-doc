This week we all were set actions for the project plan my action was to design the webpage and how it would look. As I have had a look at the Google Maps API I already knew how I wanted the website to look like.So instead of designing the site on a piece of paper or a diagram I thought I would do a quick site with a simple google map and table with a list of tours and locations around aberystwyth.
This site would not load in from database the locations were hardcoded in just as an example of how it would look.
