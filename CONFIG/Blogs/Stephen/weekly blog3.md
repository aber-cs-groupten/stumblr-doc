This week we had an extra meeting in which I showed the group my design for the webite I had done and explained how it would work when it was finished. The actions set during this meeting was to create a GitHub account and I had an action to go along to the github session to learn more as I would be using it to save my webpage. We also decided on the name of our project which is Stumblr I also said I would work on a simple logo for the project as I would use it in the banner of my webpage.
