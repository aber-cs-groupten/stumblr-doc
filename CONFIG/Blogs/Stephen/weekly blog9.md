This week we worked on he prototype so my prototype website came in handy. We couldn't get it to work from getting data from the server so we hard coded it to show what it would do when the databse interaction worked. We showed the prototype to Bernie and we got some feedback to work on such as getting rid of radio button to choose which tour to veiw. this was the last week we would be meeting before christmas break so we talked about stuff that needs to be done before coming back.
