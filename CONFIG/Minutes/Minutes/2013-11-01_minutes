Matters Arising
----------------
1.Reviewing everyones proccess- The main topic for this weeks meeting was too check up on how everyones tasks for the Project Plan are going. In all everyone says they are doing well, but there is a lack of evidence for this. So it has been decided that everyone is too upload their progress on to GitHub. Charlie is to add descriptions/scenarios to his Use Case diagrams.
ACTION- Charlie, updates Use Cases.
ACTION- All, upload work on to GitHub.

2.GitHub- Some members are still to yet post their usernames on the Facebook page so they can be added to the repository.
Action- Kenny and Keiran, sign up for GitHub and post username on facebook wall.


New Business
