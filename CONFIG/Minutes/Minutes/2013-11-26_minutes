Matters Arising
----------------
1. Design Spec- Work carried on today from fridays meeting. We studied the class diagrams in more detail and mapped all classes with methods and variables which we think will be needed/used in the program. This will help all members of the team when it comes to their area of the design spec as everyone will have an understanding of the program.
