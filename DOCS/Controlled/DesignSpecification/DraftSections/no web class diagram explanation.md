We have decided not to have class diagrams for our website as there are no real classes for our website. We have no classes because we are not using Object Oriented PHP; we think that, because the web interface is fairly simple, that it would be unnecessary. However, the website is modular in that it uses JavaScript with the Google Maps API and various other technologies (MySQL, PHP, etc). These modules are kept separate to enhance maintainability.
