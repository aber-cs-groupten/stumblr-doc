Example Scenarios for Extended Functionality - Android
======================================================

Create route
------------

The user will be able to 'tag' their walk(s) with keywords to aid searching on the website. The user will be able to create a Facebook event (through a Facebook app), and invite friends to such an event. The user will also be able to add a scorecard, in the instance of a game of Pub Golf. Another function available would be to generate a QR code to the Facebook event URL, to help the user share the event effectively.

Record route
------------

The user will be able to add a 'top tip' for every location; for example, a favourite drink or best place to sit. The user will also be able to choose 'rules' and/or 'forfeits' for each location for the followers of the walk - within the context of Pub Golf.

Complete route
--------------

The user will be able to choose to share the create event on Facebook, as well as sharing the generated QR code.

System
------

The user will be able to integrate the application with their Facebook account.
