We have decided not to have class diagrams for our website as there are no real classes for our website.
We have no real classes because we are not using Object Orientated PHP because we think it would be much simpler doing it without it for this website.
We do have parts of the website you could call classes such as the Google maps API that is in JavaScript and the database interaction that is in PHP.
