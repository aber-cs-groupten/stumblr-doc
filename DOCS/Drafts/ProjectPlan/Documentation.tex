	\begin{section}{INTRODUCTION}
		\begin{subsection}{Purpose of This Document}
			The purpose of this document is to show that we have met the outlined objectives specified by the client. 

The main objective of the project is to create an application to compile and process data based on a walking tour. The data will be stored in a database which is sent data from a mobile application. The mobile application will guide people around the walk, showing them places of interest along the route. The application will be able to build a number of walks, showing the locaton and details of places of interest such as a short description, long description and photo about each point. All textual data will be stored in English.

The main objective quoted as follows: "Walking Tour Creator (WTC) is a computer-based system to compile data about a walking tour, and structure it in a database that can be used by a mobile application which guides people around the walk, showing them places of interest along the way. WTC will be able to build a number of related walks, showing the location and details of places of interest along with photos, audio, video, about each place. All textual data will be stored in English." \\

This document will show we have managed to simplify these into a set of manageable goals. Gantt charts and GitHub's contribution analysis functionality will be used in conjunction to show and monitor the progress of the project's major tasks and other milestones. We are also implementing a risk analysis system that should alert us to the various problems that we may face whilst completing our objectives, and also allow us to mitigate the risks involved.
		\end{subsection}
	
		\begin{subsection}{Scope}
			This document should take into account the specifications of the project. This document includes an overview of our proposed systems - which will encompass our choice of platforms, some high-level architectures and a description of prospective users. The document also contains; a use case diagram giving an overview of how the app and the web systems will interact, mock-ups and descriptions of the UI design and how both applications will interact with the user, a Gantt chart which displays the start and end dates for the main milestones, and a risk analysis for the project.
		\end{subsection}
		
		\begin{subsection}{Objectives}
			These main objectives are to show our initial plans for the project. These goals include an overview of our proposed system, a set of use case diagrams, user interface designs, a Gantt chart, and a risk analysis.
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{Produce an overview of our proposed system, which matches our client's specifications.}
				\item{Produce a set of detailed use case diagrams to define the interactions with the system components and users and provide them with a concise explanation, along with example usage scenarios.}
				\item{Create a UI for the Android and web systems we will employ, with a succinct explanation for our chosen design.}
				\item{Employ the usage of a Gantt chart, to document our expected progress as a team.}
				\item{Highlight aspects of our project plan which may cause us difficulties in completing our assigned work in a timely manner.}

	\begin{section}{SYSTEM OVERVIEW}
		\begin{subsection}{Introduction}
			Our proposed system is an application that will allow the user to create guided tour, with waypoints that include photographs and descriptions. We will implement the ability to record new routes via an Android interface and view previously recorded routes via a web interface.
		\end{subsection}

		\end{subsection}
				
		\clearpage
		\begin{subsection}{Client and Server Languages}
			The server will use a MySQL database as backend and a PHP, HTML, and JavaScript frontend. The Android application will use Java and the associated Google APIs as programming languages.
		\end{subsection}
	\end{section}
	
	\begin{section}{Platforms and High Level Architecture}
		\begin{subsection}{Mobile Architecture}
			\begin{subsubsection}{Operating System}
				It is stated in the specification set by the client that the system is to be designed for Android mobile phones.
			\end{subsubsection}
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{Location Derivation}
				The user's location will primarily be derived over GPS, but also may be derived from WiFi and Cell network, using Google's Location API, a functionality which is present within Android.
			\end{subsubsection}
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{Connectivity}
				The application will need to use several aspects of a mobile phone's connectivity - for a start, when the user is creating a walk, each waypoint will need to be marked with GPS coordinates. Then a further functional requirement specifies that the application must be able to upload each route in an HTTP POST to a remote server. This obviously requires the utilisation of internet connectivity - the application will support uploading over both WiFi (or 802.11 Wireless LAN) and over the mobile network. \\
				
				Being able to upload over WiFi and the mobile network introduces problems with the upload of the "route package" - uploading over the mobile network will take considerably longer than over WiFi, not to mention increasing the impact on the user's battery life. Because of this the system will be designed to alter the size and quality of each image within the route package, based on connection type. If the mobile network is being used (rather than WiFi), then the images will be "shrunk" in size and the JPEG compression will be slightly increased to compensate for the connection difference. \\
				
				The problem of connection instability must also be addressed. The application must be robust enough to reliably deliver a finished route over HTTP - a problem when using a mobile network or WiFi. The application will be able to handle connection outages and instability, and subsequently resume or retry transmission when a stable connection is restored.
			\end{subsubsection}
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{Usage of Other Hardware}
				The application must be able to attach photos for each waypoint along the route. These photos will be accessible either through the device's camera, or through the device's gallery. This means that some Android API calls must be used to be able to access the camera functionality and the device's file system.
			\end{subsubsection}
		\end{subsection}
		
		\clearpage
		\begin{subsection}{Web Architecture}
			\begin{subsubsection}{Server-Side Scripting}
				PHP is the chosen server-side scripting language. It is sufficiently fast and light enough to serve our needs, and has a reputation for stability. PHP is also excellent for HTML page generation, MySQL database integration, and page updating via asynchronous technologies like AJAX.
			\end{subsubsection}
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{Client-Side Scripting}
				For more dynamic areas of the web interface, and client-side access to some of the APIs provided by Google, we will be using Javascript. As part of the extended functionality there may also be AJAX implemented in the web interface, which will help the user retrieve walks from a search function.
			\end{subsubsection}
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{Database}
				MySQL is a popular and widely used database platform which will be used to store the data from each route. This will be used as a backend for both the Android application's upload function, and the web interface.
			\end{subsubsection}			
			
			\begin{subsubsection}{APIs}
				A large part of the web interface's codebase will revolve around generating a map with the Google Maps API. The API will allow us to dynamically generate a map containing the waypoints for each route.
			\end{subsubsection}

			\begin{subsubsection}{Android Version}
				The android SDK version we are using is 8. This will allow our application to run on any android devices running version 2.2 or higher.
			\end{subsubsection}
