Source code access
==================

Because we structured our repositories in a non-standard way to ensure that we
didn't mix code bases in our Git repositories. (This is generally considered bad
Git practice). It also made working with Android Studio's Git integration far
easier.

I have included the following items in this directory:
  * A .tar.gz file of the Android repository (including source code)
  * A MYSQL dump of the database (populated with test data)
  * The source code for the website
  
The Android repository is also online, located at:
  * [http://github.com/charlienewey/CSG10](http://github.com/charlienewey/CSG10)
